This is a training project Client-Server App for learning Node.js, React, Express, Sequelize with Sqlite3

author: Vladilen Minin [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivDjWYcKDZI), [his school](https://result.school) (as thanks)

### The skills I got:
+ work with Node.js and npm
+ create a simple Express server on Node.js 
+ create a single-page React app
+ use hooks, routes and context from React
+ use Mongoose and MongoDB - (was excluded from the project - MongoDB blocks russian IP and cannot be used without a VPN) 
+ use Sequelize with Sqlite3, create models with references, create and select objects - (as Mongoose-MongoDB replacement)
+ use [materialize-css](https://materializecss.com)
+ find troubles where not, resolve them and rollback changes
+ and more...

### The problems encountered
+ MongoDB is not accessible from Russia without VPN
+ React version is different from the version in the tutorial (routes.js)
